# BankTransaction


In a distributed banking system where money is transferred between accounts in different banks (possibly on different computers), several issues can arise. Here’s a breakdown of the potential problems, mitigations, and a sample code implementation in Java to demonstrate these mitigations:

1. Issues in the System
Network Failures: The communication between the sender's and receiver's systems could fail due to network issues, leading to inconsistent states (e.g., money is debited from the sender but not credited to the receiver).

Partial Failures: If a transfer operation is only partially completed (e.g., debiting succeeds but crediting fails), it could lead to incorrect account balances.

Concurrency Issues: Multiple transactions could be processed simultaneously, leading to race conditions where the same funds are transferred more than once or incorrect balances are calculated.

Security Issues: Transmitting transaction details over the network could expose them to interception or tampering.

Data Integrity: Ensuring that the transaction data remains consistent and correct across distributed systems can be challenging.

2. Mitigations
Two-Phase Commit Protocol (2PC): This protocol ensures that all participating systems agree to commit or abort a transaction. It helps maintain consistency across distributed systems.

Retry Mechanism: Implement a retry mechanism for network communication failures, ensuring that transient issues don’t cause permanent transaction failures.

Locks and Synchronization: Use locks to ensure that account data is not modified concurrently by multiple transactions.

Encryption: Use encryption for transmitting sensitive data to prevent interception and tampering.

Atomic Transactions: Use transactional systems that support atomic operations to ensure that either both debit and credit operations succeed or both fail.

Explanation of the Code:
Account Class: Represents a bank account with methods to debit and credit the account. It uses a ReentrantLock to ensure that debit and credit operations are thread-safe.

Bank Class: Handles the money transfer between two accounts. It performs a simple two-phase commit by first debiting the sender's account and then crediting the receiver's account. If crediting fails, it rolls back the debit.

Main Class: Creates accounts, performs a transfer, and prints the result. It simulates a basic scenario where money is transferred between two accounts.

Enhancements for Real-World Application:
Persistent Storage: Accounts and transactions would typically be stored in a database to handle power failures and restarts.

Transaction Logging: Implement logging to record all transactions for auditing and recovery purposes.

Security Measures: Encrypt sensitive data, use secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS), and implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.

This code provides a basic framework to understand how to implement and handle transactions in a distributed banking system while mitigating some common issues.
